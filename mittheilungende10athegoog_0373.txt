scriptione of this kind ἰ Dilitrianos had four times been prosecu-
tor annonae-The eirenarchio and the prosecutio annonae are enu-
merated among the munera personalia, in the Diqest.50‚4‚18‚3.

About three miles south of Fughla is a village Andia or An-
diya. There can he no doubt that it is an ancient site, for in-
scriptione abound here as at Fughla, and the modern name is
obviously only a slight alteration of the ancient Andeda 3 but
we were also fortunate in finding the corroborative evidence

of the following inscription, which is engraved on a small
broken pedestal in the cemetery.

⁴ Prot. Mommsen kindly replied to my enquiry on this point. See aod.
Theodec„ 13. 9, 4, on the prosecutio annonae.

² ln line 12 it is doubtful whether the letter after Α is Ν or Μ οι· ΙΙ οι· Π.
'Phe third letter from the end os line 13 is perhaps Π οι· Γ. Line 2 is com·
plete on the right. Line 1 is complete.
