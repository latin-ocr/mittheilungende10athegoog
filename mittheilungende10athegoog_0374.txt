The restoration of lines 8-9 is very doubtful. Julius Epa-
gathus dedicated to the Senate and People some objects of art,
ἄγαλμα οι· ἀγάλματα. The gap at the end of 7 and beginning of
8 perhaps contained the name ot the deity whose image was
dedicated: an example of this custotn occurs G. Ι. G. 3946,
τοὺς πέντε Ἔρωτας τῇ γλυκυτάτη πατρίδι (ἀνέθηκεν). An other
part of the dedicatory offering seems to be described in the
beginning os 9 ¹. The inscription probably belongs to the first
century after Christ.

A few rare coins bear the legend ΟΥΕ ΡΒΙΑΝ Ω Ν. The
ethnic was otherwise unknown, and we were therefore much
pleased to discover the following inscription in the cemetery
of Andia.
