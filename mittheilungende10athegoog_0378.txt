lt is important for the proper esti mate of Ptolemy’s map to
compare these results with his evidence. His list of the dis-
trict Cabalia mentions together the following four towns—
Pogla, Menedemion, Ouranopolis, Pisinda. It is certainly
tempting to substitute for the improbable Ouranopolis the
form Ouerbianopolis and for Menedemion Περμινοδέων δῆμος,
and we should then have four of the five cities side by side,
but the change is violent.

Ptolemy utterly misrepresents the situation of these two
districts, if we accept the far better authority ol Strabo. Ac·
cording to the latter Milya or Milyas extends from Termessos
and Isinda to Sagalassos, and the cities which must then be
included in it are Pogla, Andeda, Ouerbe. the Perminodeis‚
Comana Colonia, the town overhanging the Kestel lake on the
north, and Cretopolis. Ptolemy however places most of these
towns in Cabalia. He places the district Milyas in the heart of
Lycia, and assigns the Pisidian town Milyas to Cabalia. Ac-
cording to Strabo Cabalis or Cabalia extends from Cibyra east·
warde, and the whole valley of the Gebren Su, together with
the highlying districtos Ali Fachreddin Yaila and the lake of
Sugut must be included in it. of the nine towns which Pto-
lemy enumerates in Cabalia. only Ariassos (perhaps Hassan
Pasha) and Corbasa (northeast from Kemer) belong to it.There
can be little doubt that Strabo is correct, and Ptolemy utterly
wrong. Ptolemy places Corbasa in Cabalis and Cormasa in
Phrygian Pisidia. These are two names of the same place,
which is called Colbasa by Hierocles, and which strikes coins
with the legend ΚΟΛΒΑΟΟΕΩΝ, implying also a form
Colbassos. The name has been corrupted in Strab., p. 570, to

Ταρὸασσός, unless we accept this as one more variety of the
Greek attempts to render a Pisidian name¹.

⁸ So Olba of Cilicia Tracheia is given twice, in Cilicia and in Cappado-
cia, as M. Waddington has shown.
