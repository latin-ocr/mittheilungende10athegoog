the ruins near Kirk Gt‘iz at the foot of the pass to Padem
Agatch belong to the small town Diki Tanavra. The exact
form of the latter name is quite uncertain: it occurs as Dikio-
tanabra‚ Adiketanaura, DiketanaurOS, Dikitanahra, Kitan-
naura, Adeia Tanaura, and in Hierocles as Demou Kanaura.
Having exhausted the Pamphylian plain, Hierocles crosses the
pass os Termessus. in which lay the three towns Iohia, Ter-
messus‚ and Eudokias generally united under one bishop.

The variation in the initial letter in Trebena or Trebenna
and Perhena is apparently due to a peculiar sound in Pamphy·
lian. The same variation occurs in Aspendos, on whose an-
cient coins the legend ΕΣΤΡΕΔΙΙΥΣ occurs, where ΤΡ
represent the same sound which was afterwards indicated by
the Greek symbol Π.

Vl. The Province Pamphylia.

The Roman Colony Julia Augusta Fida Comana, about six
miles southeast of the lake of Kestel, was founded B. C. 6.
lt was in the province of Galatia, as is proved hy the men-
tion of the lcqatus Auqusti, Cornelius Aquila, on the miles-
tone¹, which was erected there when the colony was founded
and the system of roads connecting it with the military cen-
tre, Antioch of Pisidia, was completed. The road from An·-
tioch to Comana must certainly have passed through Cremna
Colonia and then along the northern shore of the Kestel Lake,
but the rest of its course is quite uncertain.The total distance
from Antiochia to Comana is given as CXXll Roman miles ².

On another inscription of Comana³‚ dated under Antoni-

nus Pius, Q. Voconius Saxa, lcqatus Auqusti, is mentioned,
and M. Waddington informs ine that he was governor of the
