Provinoe Lycia-Pamphylia 149 A. D. Between 6 Β. C. and
149 A. D.‚ therefore, comana and the country round had been
transferred from the province of Galatia to that of Lycia-Pam·
phylia. This is confirmed by the authority os Ptolemy, who
assigns the whole ol' central and southern Pisidia to the Ro·
man Pamphylia, and gives only the northern districts of Pi·
sidia (Apollonia, Antioch‚ Amblada, Neapolis, Pappa and Mis-
thion) to the Roman Galatia. The entire valleys of the Gebren
Tchai, of lsbarte„ and of the rivers Eurymedon, Melas, and
Cestros, were during the second century governed by the le·
gate os Lycia· Pamphylia, and Aufidius Coresinus, whom Μ.
Perrot¹ makes governor of Galatia, must certainly be assi-
gned to Lycia · Pamphylia.

This reorganisation doubtless took place when the province
of Lycia· Pamphylia was constituted by Vespasian‚ and pla-
ced under a legatus Auqusti.

When the provinces were reorganised by Diocletian, the
boundaries of Pamphylia on the north were altered. The val-
ley of the Gebren Su remained attached to Pamphylia, also
the middle and lower valleys of the Cestrus and Eurymedon,
and probably the whole valley of the Melas, but the country
along the Buldur lake, the valley of lsbarta, Sagalassos, and
the llan Ova at the head of the Eurymedon ² were made part
ol the new province of Pisidia. The Byzantius lists imply a
further division into Prima, and Secunda Pamphylia. Μ.
Waddington (Rev. Numism. 1883, p. 29) remarks that the
subdivision of Pamphylia is posterior to the list of Hierocles.
This is not correct. (l) The Epistle of the Bishops of the Region
oi Pamphylia ιο the Emperor Leo is signed by fifteen bishops
of Pamphylia Secunda, but not by any bishop of Pamphylia
Prima ³. lt is therefore clear that in Α. D. 458 the bishopries
of Pamphylia were dividcd between the metropolis of Side
