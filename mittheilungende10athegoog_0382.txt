(Prima) and the metropolis of Perga (Secunda). (2) Hierocles
enumerates first all the towns of Secunda Pamphylia, and then
those of Prima. Unless tlte division existed in his time, it is
hardly possible that he should have so accurately followed
tbe partition between the two districts.Pr0bably the bishoprues
were apportioned between the two metropolem, but no civil
division had been made. Hierocles follows the ecclesiastical
classification ¹, as ὁ Τυμῧριαὸέων (ἐπίσκοπος), and he always
puts δήμου in the genitive, implying ἐπίσκοποςτ he therefore
placed first all the towns under the metropolis Perga. On the
other hand his order of enumerating the cities of Phrygia Pa·
catiana disregards the division of that province between the
two metropoleis of Laodiceia and Hierapolis, and proves that
the division was unknown to him.

Vll. Corrections.

l may take this opportunity of correcting some topographi
cal mistakes into which l have fallen
(l) Colonia Parlais. ln the Bulletin de Corrcspondancc Helle'-
nique, 1883, p. 318 l have proved that 3 Roman Colony exis-
ted at Khatyn Serai, south of leonium· As only one Roman
colony in Lycaonia remained to be placed on the map, Par-
lais, l drew the conclusion that it was situated at Khatyn Se·
rai. Since that time M. Waddington (Rev. Numism. 1883, p.
57), followed by M. lmhoof·Blumer (Monnaies qrccques, p.
347), have published coins which prove that Lystra also was
a colony· My argument therefore ceases to have any validity ;
but the choice of names is restricted to the two, Colonia Par·
lais and Colonia Lystra. We must look to the results of Mr
Sterrett's exploration of northern lsauria to decide the doubt.
