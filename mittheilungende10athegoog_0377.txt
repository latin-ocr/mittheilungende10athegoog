same valley, it is natural tn find a native of Isinda inscribing
his name on the rock.

One other name remeius in the passage of Hierocles, δήμου
Μενδενέωω). Two inscriptions found by Mr Α. H. Smith and
me give the true form of the name,and show that asyllable has
been lost in the text of Hierocles. 'l'he people were named
Perminodeis, and they inhabited the lower valley, between
lstanoz and the lake of Kestel.A little south of the point where
the river of lstanoz flows into the lake, the village of Kiailja
Agatch lies about a mile from the west bank of the river,
among the hills. Near the village there is a little rock sanc-
tuary, where it is evident that cutting of the rocks was com-
bined with a certain amount of building to produce a small
temple. The place is now entirely dismantled‚ but a number
of inscriptions on the rock, of which Mr A. H. Smith and l
deciphered seven with great difficulty, reveal the original
sanctity of the shrine, the deity to whom it was dedicated,
and the name of the district. One os the inscriptions was well·
cut in large bold letters. lt is as follows:

ΤΙΚΛΡΟΥΣΩΝΑΠΟΛΛΩΝΙΠΕΡΜΙΝΟ
ΔΕΩΝΕΥΧΗΝ

Τι. Κλ. Ῥούσων Ἀπόλλωνι Περμινοδὲων εὐχήν.

The name Περμινοδὲων occurs in a second inscription, and is
therefore perfectly certain.

Of these five places which Hierocles enumerates in succes·
sion,lsinda and the people Perminodeis lie on the lstanoz Tchai,
while the other three are in the valley of a tributary stream.
While they form a group,and are therefore properly enumerated
side by side, it is clear that the order in which Hierocles men·
tions them is rather haphazard: but if we transpose his Σίνδοι
and his Σινδαῦνδα, the order is true. On this hypothesis the
original text was δήμου Περμινοδὲων, Πώγλα, Ἀνδηδα, Βὲρὸη,
”Ισινὸα.
