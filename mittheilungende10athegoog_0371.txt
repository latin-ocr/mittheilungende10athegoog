written here. Βίρῧη is correct, but Σινδαῦνδα has been corrup-
ted so much that no one has hitherto recognised in it the city
Andeda, well-known to numismatists: it appears more cor-
rectly in the Notitiae Episcopatuum as Sandidos or Sandida
(ἰ. e· [εἰ]ς ”Ανὸηδα).

Of these five cities the site of Pogla alone has yet been de-
termined certainly. Prof. Kiepert recognised that the 'l'urkish
village Fulla retains the ancient name: the local pronuncia-
tion appeared to me to be, not Fulla, but Fughla, which ap·
proaches very closely to the usual Byza'ntine form Πούγλα.
lsinda has been conjecturally identified with the rnodern Ista·
noz, but the identification has not been generally accepted.
No suggestion bas ever been made about Berbe, Andeda, and
the demos of the Mendeneis.

ln June 1884 Mr. Α. Η. Smith and Ι explored part of the
Taurus valley¹.Fugla is obviously an ancient site: we copied a
number of inscriptions, none of which give any evidence as to
the ancient name, but there can he no reasonable doubt that
Kiepert was right in identifying Fughla with Pogla.The follo-
wing inscription, on a large basis in the cemetery, is of some
interest.
