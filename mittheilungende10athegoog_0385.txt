of Lycaonia from the rest. Many difficulties disappear if we
treat Kirli as a purely Turkish name. The town near Kirli
was a station on the Roman road from iconium to Antioch.
Misthia, as the Anonymus Ravennensis proves, was a station
on a road in this district: it was also one of the two cities of
the Orondeis. Pappa also was a city ol‘ the Orondeis, and was
afterwards included in the Byzantius Pisiclia‚while Misthia
was in Lycaonia. Now the order in Hierocles favours the pla·
cing of Pappa southwest of Antiocheia, on the road thence by
Hadrianopolis to Tyriaion (we know also from the ancwRav.
that it was a station on a road). As to Misthia, Hierocles pla-
ces it next to Amblada: Hence there can be little doubt that
it is somewhere towards the northeast of Beisheher Get, and
in all probability at the site near Kirli. ln regard to Amblada,
the difficulty is to find a site which can reasonably be inclu-
ded in Lycaonia, and yet be in the country towards Eget-dir
Get ¹. Α site at the extreme northwestern end of the lake of
Beisheher would satisfy these, and Hirschfeld mentions that
remains exist at Beldjeis. As to Carallia, there is every rea-

son to connect it with the lake Caralis: the Byzantine lists
sometimes have the form Coralia, and the lake is called Co·-

ralis in Strabo. An ancient site existed somewhere at the sou·
thern end ol‘ the lake, as Sir C. Wilson copied inscriptions at
Beisheher; and to this site we may assign the name Carallia².
Μ. Waddington (Rev. Numism. 1883, p. 36 ff.) rightly re·-
jects Kereli or Kirli as the site of Carallia, but on account of
his belief that the Byzantine Pamphylia did not extend so lar
north asl have extended it, he inclines to place Car-allia much
further south, in a country which 1 believe is too mountai-

nous to support the cities placed there by M. Waddington.
