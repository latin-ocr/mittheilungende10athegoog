V. TREBENNA of Pamphylia.

Trebenna struck some very rare coins. The British Museum
possesses tw0, the first of which was published by Borrell
(Num. chron.1846)‚ the second by Waddington (Rev. Numi-rm.
1853. p. 97). The latter remarks that the sole reference to the
city is in Ptolemy, who places Trebendai among the Lycian
cities about Mount Massicytos. He therefore concludes that
Trebenna is a Lycian town· But Ptolemy includes the Pisi-
dian Sagalassos in the same group. lt has not been observed
that all the Byzan tine lists mention Trebenna as a city of Pam-
phylia Secunda.Hierocles has itin the form Tresena,which may
be unhesitatingly corrected to Trebena. The Notitiae have the
forms Perbaina and Perbena. The Epistle of the Bishops of
Pamphylia Secunda to the emperor Leo (Α. Ι). 458) is signed
by Polemon of Trebenna. These authorities far outweigh
Ptolemy.

The hou ndary between Lycia and Pamphylia is not uncertain:
it lies in the mountainons and almost trackless region between
Elmali and Termessus. Trebenna then is in Pamphylia, east
of the mountains. Now any one who reads the description gi-
ven by Spratt and Forbes¹ of the ruins at Evde Khan, in the
Pamphylian plain close to the entrance of the pass to Termes·
sos, will certainly conclude that a city existed there, and the
order of Hierocles assigns to that city the name Trebennaflie·
, rocles gives the cities of the Pamphylian plain as follows:
Perga, Syllaion‚ MagydoS, Anaua, Demou Olbianou ², Tre-
benna, Diki Tauavra: these are enumerated in proper order
around the plain, if we assume that Olbia has been correctly
placed by Spratt and Forbes (which seems certain), and that

 

⁴ Confirmed by Hirschfeld, Berlin. Honatsber. 1874, p. 718, who rightly
reflects the ancient name suggested by Spratt and ForbeS, but proposes no
ot er.

² Hierocles has the corrupt form Demou ouliambos. ·
