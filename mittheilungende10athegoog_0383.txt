p. 76, 1 have stated the opinion that Hadrianopolis was si-
tuated at lsakli. This is absolutely wrong. A passage in Cin-
namus makes it perfectly plain that Hadrianopolis was si·
luated on the direct road from Philomelium to leonium, south
os a village Gaita, which retains its name to the present day
as Agal't. This road has been traversed by my late friend Co-
lonel J. D. Η. Stewart (who was afterwards with Gordon in
Khartum). His estimates of distance are from Ak Sheher (Phi-
lomelium) Agayit 7, Doghan Hissar 17, ‘l'chir 29, Kavakli 48,
Konia 64 English miles. 'Phe site of Hadrianopolis was near
Doghan Hissar. Mr J. R. S. Sterrett has correctly placed Ha·
drianopolis here¹, though the inscription which he gives as
evidence does not really afford any prees, as it merely states
that a native of Hadrianopolis was buried here. This city was
included in the Byzantine Pisidia.

one from Dorylaion to Amorion, and the other from Synnada

Kolchash is clearly false: it contains the word aqatch, trec (pronouneed dtch).
