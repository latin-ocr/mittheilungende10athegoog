Ἡ βουλὴ καὶ ὁ δῆμος Μάρκον Πλάνκιον Κορνηλιανὸν Γάϊον, ἀρε
χιε[ρ]ασσὶμενον τῶν Σεῧαστῶν, φιλόπατριν, φιλότειμον, miae-nb γ]ί·
νους τοῦ πρωτεύοντος παρ’ ἡμεῖν, ἀρχιερασάμενον δὲ καὶ ἐν τῇ Οὖ-
ερῧιανῶν πόλει, εὐνοίας ἕνεκεν τῆς εἰς τὴν πατρίδα.

It is to be inferred from this inscription that ἡ Οὑερῧιανῶν
πόλις was not far distant from Andia, since a citizen of the
one town could hold a priesthood in the other. This is con-
firmed by the order in HierocleS, Βέρῧη, Σινδαῦνδα. The No-
titiae Episcopatuum also always mention together Andeda and
Berbe or Barbe.

Berbe must therefore have been situated near Andeda in the
valley of the Taurus. There was probably an other town in the
valley of the same tributary where Andeda is situated, near
the village of Zivint. This town and Andeda are grouped by
nature as a pair, and hence they are always mentioned toge-
ther in the Byzantine writers. The inscriptions found at Zi-
vint present the closest possible analogy to those of Andia,
but they are not os sufficient interest to be publjshed here.

The spelling Βέρῧη in later documents corresponds to Οὖ-
έρὸη in coins and inscriptions: so e. q. Βαῧᾶς and Οὒαουᾶς.
Andeda has been corrupted in the text of Hierocles to Sin-
daunda, where the first syllable has been imported from the
preceding narne Σίνδοι. These names have been the cause of
much difficulty and of some errors among modern writers, and
M. Waddington in his Voyaqe Numismatique (s. v. Isinda),
identifies Hierocles' Sindaunda and the Sandida os the Noti-
-tiae with the Sinda of Livy (XXXVllI. 15). The facts are as
follows, (l) Besides the city Andeda, there was a city lsinda,
about twelve miles to the south, near the modern Istanoz, at
the western end of the pass leading from Pamphylia across
Mount Taurus by 'Permessus in to Pisidia (τῶν κατὰ Τερμησ-
σὸν στενῶν καὶτῆς εἰς τὸ ἐντὸς τοῦ Ταύρου ὑπερθέσεως δι’ αὐτῶν
ἐπὶ ’Ίσινδα Strab. p. 631). The road which crosses this pass,
and which must of necessity go through lstanoz, is of ex-
treme importance. All intercourse between Pamphylia on the
