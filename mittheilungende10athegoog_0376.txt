south, and Caria, Iunia, and the Lycus valley‚ on the north,
must take this route. Isinda therefore was an important point,
commanding a narrow gateway in the hills on the north side
of the lstanoz valley. Its coinage is considerable, and very si·
milar in character to that of Termessos. lt is mentioned by
Livy as lsionda, and the war between it and Termessos is na·
tural between two powerful cities, whose territories were con·
terminous. (2) A town Isinda of Lycia is mentioned only once,
in an inscription publisbed by M.Waddington (Le Bas,1290),
who at first identified this city with the preceding one, hut
afterwards distinguished them. 'l'he second opinion is more
probable. (3) Α small town Sinda in Cabalis (Isinda is in Mi·
lyas or Milya) is mentioned by Livy (xxxviii. 15) and by
Strabo (p. 570, 630). 'l‘he passage of Livy shows that it was
situated either on the ruins close to Aghlan Keui ¹, about
twelve miles north east of Cibyra, or possibly a little further
on the march of Manlius in the valley of Get Hissar. This si·
tuation agrees admirably with the words of Strabo.

Isinda of Risidia then was situated near lstanoz, the which
shows by numerous large sculptured stenes the proximity of
an ancient city. 'l‘he inscriptions which we copied are insi-
gnificant, but an inscription found in an other part of the val·
ley mentions a citizen of isinda as worshipper of the god of a
neighbouring people. The inscription is engraved on the side
of the rock sanctuary described in the following paragraph.

The inscription does not prove anything as to the situation of
Isinda, but when on other grounds Isinda is placed in the
